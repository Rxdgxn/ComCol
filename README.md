# ComCol (Comment collector)
Tool that removes every comment from a specified file, and collects the comments in a separate file (e.g. : main.c.comm, main.py.comm).
This project has been rewritten (again), and yet it might still contain a lot of bugs, especially since it isn't fully finished.

**[UPDATE]: ComCol has reached its end, since the implementation is very messy and it has become too tiring to maintain it. I will probably try to make another parser-like program at some point in the future, similar to ComCol. Even so, I think it would be best to archive this repo, to serve as an example of what to (not) do in future projects.**

Usage: *cargo run \_filename\_*
