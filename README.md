# ComCol (Comment collector)
Tool that removes every comment from a specified file, and collects the comments in a separate file (e.g. : main.c.comm, main.py.comm).
This project has been rewritten (again), and yet it might still contain a lot of bugs, especially since it isn't fully finished.

Usage: *cargo run \_filename\_*
